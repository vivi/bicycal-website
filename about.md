# who are we?
BicyCAL is a cooperatively run and student founded organization at UC Berkeley
that aims to empower UCB students, faculty and staff to successfully integrate
the bicycle into their daily lives.  To that end we seek to provide a space
where members of our community can learn how to maintain, operate and love their
bicycles in an inclusive and safe place.  We offer peer-to-peer bicycle repair
and maintenance education in a radically positive environment.

# volunteer!
To become a volunteer, just stop by [our shop](/#location) during [open
